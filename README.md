# CounterList
* **Purpose of the app:** 
   This app was created to display the characters in the multiple games shown and display their information as well as their most popular and best counters.
* **How to use:**
   This app is divided into two sections based on the two games, Overwatch 2 and League of Legends. By simply clicking on the video game logo's for their respective games, you will see all availiable heroes/champions. Clicking one will not only display the characters lore and abilities, but will also outline the characters counters in red.
* **Features on the app:**
   The app is featured with creative designs and functionalities in each page including related animations and an intro video on the home page. The contributers used the Overwatch 2 API and League of Legends API to display all the information is a clear, concise place. In addition, since the API's are constantly updated, whenever there is a new champion/hero release, they will automatically be added to the webpage.
